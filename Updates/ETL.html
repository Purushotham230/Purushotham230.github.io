<h3>ETL</h3>
<p>ETL stands for Extract-Transform-Load and it is a process of how data is loaded from the source system to the data warehouse.  Data is extracted from an OLTP database, transformed to match the data warehouse schema and loaded into the data warehouse database.  Many data warehouses also incorporate data from non-OLTP systems such as text files, legacy systems and spreadsheets. </p>

An ETL tool extracts the data from all these heterogeneous data sources, transforms the data (like applying calculations, joining fields, keys, removing incorrect data fields, etc.), and loads it into a Data Warehouse.

The data in a Data Warehouse system is loaded with an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool. As the name suggests, it performs the following three operations âˆ’

Extracts the data from your transactional system which can be an Oracle, Microsoft, or any other relational database,
Transforms the data by performing data cleansing operations, and then
Loads the data into the OLAP data Warehouse.
You can also extract data from flat files like spreadsheets and CSV files using an ETL tool and load it into an OLAP data warehouse for data analysis and reporting. Let us take an example to understand it better.
